            <h1>About</h1>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Goldie Rich and I am the owner of Rich Photography. I was born and raised here in the great city of Saint Joseph, MO where I now reside with my wonderful husband and three furry, four-legged pups; KC, Duke, and Libby! I am an adventurer at heart and love to start new projects and expand outside of my comfort zone and try new things. My passion for family, art, and creativity sparked my photography journey and has lead me to what I do today. I am very blessed and privileged to capture my clientâ€™s unique stories, life events, memories, and milestones.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I specialize in, but am not limited to, newborn, maternity, family, couples/engagement, and senior photography. My goal as a photographer is to build relationships with my clients and to see them come back, year after year, for their photography needs. I am here not only to capture but create memories that will survive for generations to come. I take great pride in my work and client satisfaction is very important to me. Let me get to know you and your family so we can, together, create memories for a lifetime</p>
